- ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Bryn, a Software Engineering graduate (2018) from the UK, now living in West Virginia.

I started as a full-stack web developer, enhancing the digital experience of a network inspiring innovation in England's public sector.

Now, I leverage the Salesforce platform as a Software Engineer, creating apps and implementing bespoke solutions to modern day issues.

With a problem solving mind-set and an enthusiasm for exploring new things, I hope to improve both as a developer, and as a mentor to others.
